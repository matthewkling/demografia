Fecundity, seedlings
- For seedlings
  - Assume that in == out. This allows us to get per capita s-->j from j appearances
  - Assume no survival, allowing us to get mortality. Or vice versa.
  - Together, this allows us to get p-->s, assuming known P. From that we can also get p-->x

- For seed counts/outcomes, rather than providing it as data, we have to infer it within model
  - Manually specify fecundity F (point or distribution)
  - Can simulate/estimate adults per block per year, A
  - From F & A, can get propagules per year P
  
- How to structure data:
  - 1. Adults at t=0
  - 2. Known fecundity
  - 3. [projection matrix]
  
  
  
Data:
- t0 counts for s, j, a
- t5 counts for s, j, a
- individual outcome counts for j, a
- fecundity
  
  
- partial N is the t5 outcomes for the individuals starting in a given class
  - compute by doing 5 matrix projections on a vector such as [0,15,0,0], given A
- this is an unobserved latent variable, multinomially distributed
- across the K origin classes, these sum to observed N



We need an estimate of N propagules at t0, to project N_t0 to N_t5.
To get that, we use fecundity and also must calculate N adults at t = -1, 
which we can get from N adults at t0, and from adult survival (aa).

N_a_t0 = N_a_tn1 * aa
N_a_tn1 = N_a_t0 / aa
N_p_t0 = N_a_t0 / aa * F
